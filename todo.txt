0) Make a repo
0) Backup your gitlab repos on 533, and figure out why you got so many points off for that hw! the tour works!!! you also had a readme!!!
1) Create a skeleton of a Flask app using an existing template, run it on localhost, don't bother setting up the rest of the infrastructure
2) Work on one of the problems. Dont bother much with the description, or the story, focus on the problem code and implementation.
3) Create a rough plan of the site, including problem structure, site motivation, answer structure, achivement system, magntiude of volume of problems, etc.
4) Some of the problems should include working with existing binaries - for example, a toy program will be provided that communicates on a localhost socket and expects a specific protocol. The user program will interact with this provided program, and upon correct behavior, the provided program should either provide completion confirmation, or some kind of a passkey that can be submitted as confirmation. The passkeys/binaries should be unique per user (if possible), and the website should follow the projecteuler spirit
5) Read some from the data science book (unlikely to happen)
6) Wash some dishes
